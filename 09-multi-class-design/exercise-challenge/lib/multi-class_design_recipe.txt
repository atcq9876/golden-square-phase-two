RECORD THIS CHALLENGE

1. Describe the Problem
- Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

# 1
As a user
So that I can record my experiences
I want to keep a regular diary
    # Diary class (create a diary; add instances of DiaryEntry to diary)
    # DiaryEntry class (create diary entries)

# 2
As a user
So that I can reflect on my experiences
I want to read my past diary entries
    # in Diary class: some kind of return method, e.g., to return all entries?

# 3
As a user
So that I can reflect on my experiences in my busy day
I want to select diary entries to read based on how much time I have and my reading speed
    # in Diary class?: method like #best_entry to work out longest entry to read in given time with given reading speed (wpm)

# 4
As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to keep a todo list along with my diary
    # ToDo class to create instances of todos?
    # ToDoList class to create list and keep track of tasks?

# 5
As a user
So that I can keep track of my contacts
I want to see a list of all of the mobile phone numbers in all my diary entries
    # ContactsList class?
    # ToDo / ToDoList class searches for mobile phone numbers in diary entries and adds these to a contacts_list in ContactList class?



2. Design the Class System
- Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. (Can use websites like asciiflow.com, excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com for this)
- Also design the interface of each class in more detail.



3. Create Examples as Integration Tests
- Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used.


4. Create Examples as Unit Tests
- Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at a more granular level of detail.
- Encode each example as a test. You can add to the list as you go.


5. Implement the Behaviour
- After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
