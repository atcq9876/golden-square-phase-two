# golden-square-phase-two

This repo makes up phase one of the Golden Square project on the Makers bootcamp. The objectives of this project were:

- Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
- Learn to break programs up into classes.
- Learn to debug programs.
- Learn to build software as a pair.
- Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

These objectives were achieved by working through a sequence of exercises and challenges over two weeks.
