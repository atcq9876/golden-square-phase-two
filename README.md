# golden-square-phase-two

This repo contains my solutions to phase two of the Golden Square project on the Makers bootcamp (weeks one and two). The objectives I achieved during this project were:
- Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
- Learn to break programs up into classes.
- Learn to debug programs.
- Learn to build software as a pair.
- Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.
