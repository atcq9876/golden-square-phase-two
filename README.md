This repo makes up phase two of the Golden Square project on the Makers bootcamp. The objectives of this project were:

Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
Learn to break programs up into classes.
Learn to debug programs.
Learn to build software as a pair.
Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.
These objectives were achieved by working through a sequence of exercises and challenges over two weeks.

My full list of repos for this project are listed below:
